# Ix skill bootstrap — install the ix CLI, start the local backend, and map a repo.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/bootstrap.sh [repo-root] [--no-map]
#
# Flags:
#   --no-map       setup only (CLI + backend); do not run `ix map`
#   --no-backend   do not start/wait for the Docker backend (CLI install only)
#
# Env overrides:
#   IX_SKIP_INSTALL=1   skip the ix CLI install step
#   IX_SKIP_BACKEND=1   same as --no-backend
#   IX_SKIP_MAP=1       same as --no-map
#
# Requires: Node.js >= 22, git, Docker (backend), ripgrep (for `ix text`, optional).
# Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows under Git Bash / MSYS2 / WSL.
